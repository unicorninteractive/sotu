1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.702
The President:
Mr. Speaker.

2
00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:07.240
Mr. Vice President.
Members of Congress.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.109
my fellow Americans:

4
00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:14.780
We are 15 years into
this new century.

5
00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.385
Fifteen years that dawned
with terror touching

6
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:22.789
our shores; that unfolded with
a new generation fighting

7
00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.127
two long and costly
wars; that saw a vicious

8
00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:30.630
recession spread across
our nation and the world.

9
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.237
It has been. and still
is. a hard time for many.

10
00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:43.943
But tonight. we
turn the page.

11
00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.745
Tonight. after a
breakthrough year

12
00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.483
for America. our economy
is growing and creating

13
00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:53.986
jobs at the fastest
pace since 1999.

14
00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:59.567
(applause)

15
00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.279
Our unemployment
rate is now

16
00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.615
lower than it was before
the financial crisis.

17
00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.116
More of our kids
are graduating

18
00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:25.885
than ever before.

19
00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.621
More of our people are
insured than ever before.

20
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.640
(applause)

21
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.800
And we are as free
from the grip

22
00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:48.708
of foreign oil as we've
been in almost 30 years.

23
00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:52.308
(applause)

24
00:01:57.217 --> 00:02:01.488
Tonight. for the first
time since 9/11.

25
00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:05.525
our combat mission in
Afghanistan is over.

26
00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:10.480
(applause)

27
00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.698
Six years ago.
nearly 180.000

28
00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.102
American troops served in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

29
00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:19.620
Today. fewer than
15.000 remain.

30
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.876
And we salute the courage
and sacrifice of every man

31
00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.612
and woman in this 9/11
Generation who has

32
00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:27.412
served to
keep us safe.

33
00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:28.515
(applause)

34
00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.983
We are humbled and
grateful for your service.

35
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:35.344
(applause)

36
00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:06.185
America. for all that
we have endured;

37
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:10.290
for all the grit and hard
work required to come back;

38
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.293
for all the tasks that
lie ahead. know this:

39
00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:16.829
The shadow of crisis
has passed. and the

40
00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.432
State of the
Union is strong.

41
00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:25.704
(applause)

42
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.915
At this moment -- with
a growing economy.

43
00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:40.786
shrinking deficits. bustling
industry. booming energy

44
00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:44.23
production -- we have
risen from recession

45
00:03:44.23 --> 00:03:47.454
freer to write our own
future than any other

46
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.263
nation on Earth.

47
00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:53.566
It's now up to us to
choose who we want

48
00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.536
to be over the next 15 years
and for decades to come.

49
00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.773
Will we accept an
economy where only a few

50
00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:03.776
of us do
spectacularly well?

51
00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.812
Or will we commit
ourselves to an economy

52
00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:08.147
that generates rising
incomes and chances

53
00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:11.84
for everyone who
makes the effort?

54
00:04:11.84 --> 00:04:17.923
(applause)

55
00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:21.761
Will we approach the world
fearful and reactive.

56
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.197
dragged into costly
conflicts that strain

57
00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.333
our military and set
back our standing?

58
00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.737
Or will we lead wisely.
using all elements

59
00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.239
of our power to defeat
new threats and protect

60
00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.659
our planet?

61
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.978
Will we allow ourselves to
be sorted into factions

62
00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:41.558
and turned against
one another?

63
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.517
Or will we recapture the
sense of common purpose

64
00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:46.552
that has always propelled
America forward?

65
00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:52.724
In two weeks. I will send
this Congress a budget

66
00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:57.63
filled with ideas that are
practical. not partisan.

67
00:04:57.63 --> 00:04:59.65
And in the months ahead.
I'll crisscross the

68
00:04:59.65 --> 00:05:03.503
country making a
case for those ideas.

69
00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:06.406
So tonight. I want to
focus less on a checklist

70
00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:10.9
of proposals. and focus
more on the values

71
00:05:10.9 --> 00:05:12.11
at stake in the
choices before us.

72
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.880
It begins with
our economy.

73
00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:22.688
Seven years ago.
Rebekah and Ben Erler

74
00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.592
of Minneapolis
were newlyweds.

75
00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:30.996
(laughter)

76
00:05:33.66 --> 00:05:34.900
She waited
tables.

77
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.603
He worked
construction.

78
00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:41.641
Their first child.
Jack. was on the way.

79
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:45.812
They were young and
in love in America.

80
00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.814
And it doesn't get
much better than that.

81
00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:53.186
"If only we had known."
Rebekah wrote to me last

82
00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.289
spring. "what was about
to happen to the housing

83
00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.558
and construction
market."

84
00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.462
As the crisis worsened.
Ben's business dried up.

85
00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:05.364
so he took what jobs he
could find. even if they

86
00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:09.669
kept him on the road for
long stretches of time.

87
00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.3
Rebekah took out student
loans and enrolled

88
00:06:12.4 --> 00:06:15.441
in community college. and
retrained for a new career.

89
00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:20.613
They sacrificed
for each other.

90
00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:23.616
And slowly. it
paid off.

91
00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.852
They bought
their first home.

92
00:06:25.852 --> 00:06:28.587
They had a second
son. Henry.

93
00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:32.158
Rebekah got a better
job and then a raise.

94
00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:34.393
Ben is back in
construction -- and

95
00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:36.395
home for dinner
every night.

96
00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:41.99
"It is amazing." Rebekah
wrote. "what you can

97
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.172
bounce back from when you
have to...we are a strong.

98
00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:48.274
tight-knit family who
has made it through some

99
00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:52.612
very. very
hard times."

100
00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:55.848
"We are a strong.
tight-knit family who

101
00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.917
has made it through some
very. very hard times."

102
00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:03.422
America. Rebekah and
Ben's story is our story.

103
00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:07.560
They represent the
millions who have worked

104
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.398
hard and scrimped. and
sacrificed and retooled.

105
00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:14.934
You are the reason that
I ran for this office.

106
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.6
You are the people I was
thinking of six years

107
00:07:20.6 --> 00:07:23.275
ago today. in the darkest
months of the crisis.

108
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.212
when I stood on the steps of
this Capitol and promised

109
00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:30.650
we would rebuild our economy
on a new foundation.

110
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.320
And it has been your
resilience. your effort

111
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.322
that has made it
possible for our country

112
00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.992
to emerge stronger.

113
00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:41.994
We believed we could
reverse the tide

114
00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:45.498
of outsourcing and draw
new jobs to our shores.

115
00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.500
And over the past five
years. our businesses

116
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.802
have created more than
11 million new jobs.

117
00:07:49.802 --> 00:08:04.483
(applause)

118
00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.588
We believed we could
reduce our dependence

119
00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:11.657
on foreign oil and
protect our planet.

120
00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:15.460
And today. America is
number one in oil and gas.

121
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:18.731
America is number
one in wind power.

122
00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.33
Every three weeks. we
bring online as much

123
00:08:21.33 --> 00:08:25.71
solar power as we
did in all of 2008.

124
00:08:25.71 --> 00:08:26.505
(applause)

125
00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:28.241
And thanks to
lower gas prices

126
00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:30.476
and higher fuel standards.
the typical family

127
00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:34.780
this year should save
about $750 at the pump.

128
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.952
(applause)

129
00:08:42.554 --> 00:08:44.556
We believed we could
prepare our kids for

130
00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.325
a more competitive
world.

131
00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:48.427
And today. our younger
students have earned the

132
00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:51.564
highest math and reading
scores on record.

133
00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.565
Our high school
graduation rate has

134
00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.501
hit an
all-time high.

135
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:58.971
More Americans finish
college than ever before.

136
00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:05.211
(applause)

137
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.879
We believed that sensible
regulations could

138
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:10.216
prevent another crisis.
shield families from ruin.

139
00:09:10.216 --> 00:09:13.920
and encourage
fair competition.

140
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.289
Today. we have new tools
to stop taxpayer-funded

141
00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:18.824
bailouts. and a new
consumer watchdog

142
00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:21.593
to protect us from predatory
lending and abusive

143
00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.896
credit card
practices.

144
00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.598
And in the past year
alone. about 10 million

145
00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.701
uninsured Americans
finally gained

146
00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:30.703
the security of
health coverage.

147
00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.703
(applause)

148
00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:51.424
At every step. we were
told our goals were

149
00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:55.761
misguided or too
ambitious; that

150
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:59.865
we would crush jobs
and explode deficits.

151
00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.934
Instead. we've seen the
fastest economic growth

152
00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:04.569
in over a decade.
our deficits cut

153
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.740
by two-thirds. a stock
market that has doubled.

154
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.209
and health care inflation
at its lowest rate

155
00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.143
in 50 years.

156
00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:17.416
(applause)

157
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.159
This is good
news. people.

158
00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:33.499
(laughter)

159
00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:37.870
(applause)

160
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.73
So the verdict
is clear.

161
00:10:41.73 --> 00:10:44.10
Middle-class
economics works.

162
00:10:44.10 --> 00:10:47.346
Expanding
opportunity works.

163
00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:50.149
And these policies will
continue to work as long

164
00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:53.586
as politics don't
get in the way.

165
00:10:53.586 --> 00:10:55.821
We can't slow down
businesses or put our

166
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.857
economy at risk with
government shutdowns

167
00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:00.925
or fiscal showdowns.

168
00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:03.62
We can't put the security
of families at risk

169
00:11:03.62 --> 00:11:06.699
by taking away their health
insurance. or unraveling

170
00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:09.468
the new rules on Wall
Street. or refighting

171
00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:11.469
past battles on
immigration when we've

172
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:15.775
got to fix a
broken system.

173
00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:17.776
And if a bill comes
to my desk that tries

174
00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:21.347
to do any of these
things. I will veto it.

175
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.848
It will have
earned my veto.

176
00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:30.55
(applause)

177
00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.730
Today. thanks to a growing
economy. the recovery

178
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.233
is touching more
and more lives.

179
00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:44.637
Wages are finally
starting to rise again.

180
00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.638
We know that more
small business owners

181
00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.641
plan to raise their
employees' pay than

182
00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:52.277
at any time
since 2007.

183
00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:56.415
But here's the thing:
Those of us here tonight.

184
00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:58.918
we need to set our sights
higher than just making

185
00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:01.754
sure government doesn't
screw things up;

186
00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:05.324
that government doesn't halt
the progress we're making.

187
00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:08.861
We need to do more
than just do no harm.

188
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:13.265
Tonight. together. let's
do more to restore

189
00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:16.635
the link between hard work
and growing opportunity

190
00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.404
for every American.

191
00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:23.24
(applause)

192
00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:36.522
Because families
like Rebekah's still

193
00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:38.991
need our help.

194
00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:42.428
She and Ben are working
as hard as ever.

195
00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:45.498
but they've had to forego
vacations and a new car

196
00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:48.734
so that they can pay off student
loans and save for retirement.

197
00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:55.306
Friday night pizza.
that's a big splurge.

198
00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:58.444
Basic childcare for Jack
and Henry costs more than

199
00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:01.479
their mortgage. and almost
as much as a year at the

200
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.482
University of
Minnesota.

201
00:13:05.50 --> 00:13:08.186
Like millions of
hardworking Americans.

202
00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:11.323
Rebekah isn't asking
for a handout. but she

203
00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:14.126
is asking that we look
for more ways to help

204
00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:16.127
families get ahead.

205
00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:19.265
And in fact. at every
moment of economic

206
00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:21.834
change throughout our
history. this country

207
00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:26.473
has taken bold action to
adapt to new circumstances

208
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.575
and to make sure everyone
gets a fair shot.

209
00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:31.277
We set up worker
protections.

210
00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:35.147
Social Security. Medicare.
Medicaid to protect

211
00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:38.751
ourselves from the
harshest adversity.

212
00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:41.687
We gave our citizens
schools and colleges.

213
00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:44.690
infrastructure and the
Internet -- tools they

214
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.26
needed to go as far as
their effort and their

215
00:13:47.26 --> 00:13:50.94
dreams will
take them.

216
00:13:50.95 --> 00:13:52.998
That's what middle-class
economics is --

217
00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:56.368
the idea that this country
does best when everyone gets

218
00:13:56.368 --> 00:14:00.940
their fair shot. everyone
does their fair share.

219
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.142
everyone plays by the
same set of rules.

220
00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:09.81
(applause)

221
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.718
We don't just want
everyone to share

222
00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:14.719
in America's success.
we want everyone

223
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.589
to contribute to
our success.

224
00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:22.61
(applause)

225
00:14:22.61 --> 00:14:24.196
So what does middle-class
economics require

226
00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:26.198
in our time?

227
00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:30.736
First. middle-class
economics means helping

228
00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:33.973
working families feel
more secure in a world

229
00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:36.973
of constant change.

230
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.840
That means helping folks
afford childcare. college.

231
00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:43.115
health care. a
home. retirement.

232
00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:46.619
And my budget will address
each of these issues.

233
00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:48.754
lowering the taxes
of working families

234
00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.956
and putting thousands
of dollars back into

235
00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.57
their pockets
each year.

236
00:14:52.57 --> 00:14:57.563
(applause)

237
00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:01.367
Here's one
example.

238
00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.235
During World War
II. when men like

239
00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:07.439
my grandfather went off to war.
having women like my grandmother

240
00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:11.810
in the workforce was a
national security priority

241
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.113
-- so this country provided
universal childcare.

242
00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:18.684
In today's economy. when
having both parents in the

243
00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:21.553
workforce is an economic necessity

244
00:15:21.553 --> 00:15:24.757
for many families. we need
affordable. high-quality

245
00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.891
childcare more
than ever.

246
00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:31.352
(applause)

247
00:15:43.42 --> 00:15:47.780
It's not a nice-to-have
-- it's a must-have.

248
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.281
So it's time we stop
treating childcare

249
00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:54.820
as a side issue. or as a
women's issue. and treat

250
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.90
it like the national
economic priority that

251
00:15:58.90 --> 00:16:01.93
it is for all of us.

252
00:16:01.93 --> 00:16:08.12
(applause)

253
00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:13.372
And that's why my plan
will make quality

254
00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:15.540
childcare more available
and more affordable for

255
00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:17.743
every middle-class and
low-income family with

256
00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:20.612
young children in America
-- by creating more slots

257
00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:24.216
and a new tax cut of up
to $3.000 per child.

258
00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:25.584
per year.

259
00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:30.689
(applause)

260
00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:31.957
Here's another
example.

261
00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:34.259
Today. we are the
only advanced country

262
00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:36.995
on Earth that doesn't
guarantee paid sick leave

263
00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:41.300
or paid maternity
leave to our workers.

264
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.136
Forty-three million
workers have no paid

265
00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:47.372
sick leave --
43 million.

266
00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:49.942
Think about that.

267
00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:51.944
And that forces too many
parents to make the

268
00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:54.613
gut-wrenching choice
between a paycheck and

269
00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:57.249
a sick kid
at home.

270
00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:59.418
So I'll be taking new
action to help states

271
00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:02.20
adopt paid leave
laws of their own.

272
00:17:02.20 --> 00:17:04.823
And since paid sick
leave won where it was

273
00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:07.659
on the ballot last November.
let's put it to a vote

274
00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:08.794
right here in
Washington.

275
00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:09.795
(applause)

276
00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.797
Send me a bill that
gives every worker

277
00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:13.866
in America the opportunity
to earn seven days

278
00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.401
of paid sick leave.

279
00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:16.402
(applause)

280
00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:19.505
It's the right
thing to do.

281
00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:20.873
It's the right
thing to do.

282
00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:26.645
(applause)

283
00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:28.446
Of course. nothing helps
families make ends

284
00:17:28.446 --> 00:17:31.49
meet like
higher wages.

285
00:17:31.49 --> 00:17:33.452
That's why this Congress
still needs to pass

286
00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:36.54
a law that makes sure a
woman is paid the same

287
00:17:36.54 --> 00:17:38.724
as a man for doing
the same work.

288
00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:41.693
(applause)

289
00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:55.307
It's 2015.

290
00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:56.608
(laughter)

291
00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:58.976
It's time.

292
00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.746
We still need to make
sure employees get the

293
00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:03.215
overtime
they've earned.

294
00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:05.751
(applause)

295
00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.253
And to everyone in this
Congress who still

296
00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:11.223
refuses to raise the
minimum wage. I say this:

297
00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:13.625
If you truly believe you
could work full-time

298
00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:15.627
and support a
family on less than

299
00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:19.998
$15.000 a
year. try it.

300
00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:22.100
If not. vote to give
millions of the

301
00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.236
hardest-working people
in America a raise.

302
00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:31.317
(applause)

303
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.854
Now. these ideas won't
make everybody rich.

304
00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.890
won't relieve
every hardship.

305
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.26
That's not the
job of government.

306
00:18:48.26 --> 00:18:51.29
To give working families
a fair shot. we still

307
00:18:51.29 --> 00:18:53.232
need more employers to
see beyond next quarter's

308
00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.767
earnings and recognize
that investing

309
00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.769
in their workforce is
in their company's

310
00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:00.105
long-term interest.

311
00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:02.407
We still need laws that
strengthen rather than

312
00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:04.775
weaken unions. and give
American workers a voice.

313
00:19:04.776 --> 00:19:10.156
(applause)

314
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.580
But you know. things like
childcare and sick leave

315
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.260
and equal pay; things like
lower mortgage premiums

316
00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:30.35
and a higher minimum wage
-- these ideas will make

317
00:19:30.35 --> 00:19:32.304
a meaningful difference
in the lives of millions

318
00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:34.206
of families.

319
00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:36.241
That's a fact.

320
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:38.343
And that's what all
of us. Republicans

321
00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:40.712
and Democrats alike.
were sent here to do.

322
00:19:44.316 --> 00:19:47.786
Now second. to make sure folks
keep earning higher wages

323
00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:51.290
down the road. we have to
do more to help Americans

324
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.325
upgrade their skills.

325
00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:54.993
(applause)

326
00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:58.730
America thrived
in the 20th century

327
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.100
because we made high
school free. sent

328
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.102
a generation of GIs to
college. trained the

329
00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:08.240
best workforce
in the world.

330
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.242
We were ahead
of the curve.

331
00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.845
But other countries
caught on.

332
00:20:13.845 --> 00:20:16.315
And in a 21st century
economy that rewards

333
00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:20.152
knowledge like never before.
we need to up our game.

334
00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:22.154
We need to
do more.

335
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:25.924
By the end of this decade.
two in three job openings

336
00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:30.780
will require some higher
education -- two in three.

337
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.760
And yet. we still live in
a country where too many

338
00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:35.132
bright. striving
Americans are priced out

339
00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.736
of the education
they need.

340
00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:40.372
It's not fair to
them. and it's sure

341
00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:43.375
not smart for
our future.

342
00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:45.377
That's why I'm sending
this Congress a bold

343
00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:48.614
new plan to lower the cost
of community college --

344
00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:49.615
to zero.

345
00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:54.286
(applause)

346
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.130
Keep in mind 40 percent
of our college students

347
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:09.267
choose community
college.

348
00:21:09.267 --> 00:21:11.837
Some are young
and starting out.

349
00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:15.273
Some are older and
looking for a better job.

350
00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:17.476
Some are veterans and
single parents trying

351
00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:20.879
to transition back
into the job market.

352
00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:25.417
Whoever you are. this plan
is your chance to graduate

353
00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.886
ready for the new economy
without a load of debt.

354
00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:32.224
Understand. you've
got to earn it.

355
00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:34.226
You've got to keep
your grades up and

356
00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:36.228
graduate on time.

357
00:21:37.229 --> 00:21:41.66
Tennessee. a state with
Republican leadership.

358
00:21:41.66 --> 00:21:45.203
and Chicago. a city with
Democratic leadership.

359
00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:47.205
are showing that free
community college

360
00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.740
is possible.

361
00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.440
I want to spread that
idea all across America.

362
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.12
so that two years of
college becomes as free

363
00:21:54.12 --> 00:21:57.816
and universal in America
as high school is today.

364
00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:01.920
(applause)

365
00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:05.557
Let's stay ahead
of the curve.

366
00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:10.617
(applause)

367
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.120
And I want to work
with this Congress

368
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.659
to make sure those already
burdened with student

369
00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:15.667
loans can reduce their
monthly payments

370
00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:18.669
so that student debt doesn't
derail anyone's dreams.

371
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.874
(applause)

372
00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:25.43
Thanks to Vice President
Biden's great work

373
00:22:25.43 --> 00:22:28.179
to update our job training
system. we're connecting

374
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.515
community colleges with
local employers to train

375
00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:32.484
workers to fill
high-paying jobs

376
00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:36.187
like coding. and
nursing. and robotics.

377
00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:38.190
Tonight. I'm also
asking more businesses

378
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.394
to follow the lead of companies
like CVS and UPS. and offer

379
00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:46.98
more educational benefits
and paid apprenticeships

380
00:22:46.98 --> 00:22:48.100
-- opportunities that give
workers the chance to earn

381
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.368
higher-paying jobs even
if they don't have

382
00:22:50.368 --> 00:22:53.260
a higher
education.

383
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.40
And as a new generation
of veterans comes home.

384
00:22:56.41 --> 00:22:58.944
we owe them every opportunity
to live the American Dream

385
00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:00.946
they helped defend.

386
00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:03.380
Already. we've made
strides towards ensuring

387
00:23:03.381 --> 00:23:05.383
that every veteran
has access to the

388
00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:07.586
highest
quality care.

389
00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:09.955
We're slashing the backlog
that had too many veterans

390
00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:12.557
waiting years to get
the benefits they need.

391
00:23:12.557 --> 00:23:14.593
And we're making it easier
for vets to translate

392
00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:16.595
their training and
experience into

393
00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:18.563
civilian jobs.

394
00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:21.399
And Joining Forces. the
national campaign launched

395
00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:23.935
by Michelle and
Jill Biden --

396
00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:25.437
(applause)

397
00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:28.506
-- thank you. Michelle; thank
you. Jill -- has helped nearly

398
00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:31.276
700.000 veterans and
military spouses

399
00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:33.245
get a new job.

400
00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:37.245
(applause)

401
00:23:49.60 --> 00:23:52.260
So to every CEO in
America. let me repeat:

402
00:23:52.264 --> 00:23:54.131
If you want somebody who's
going to get the job

403
00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:56.201
done and done right.
hire a veteran.

404
00:23:56.201 --> 00:24:01.6
(applause)

405
00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.554
Finally. as we better
train our workers.

406
00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:18.723
we need the new economy
to keep churning out

407
00:24:18.723 --> 00:24:22.561
high-wage jobs for
our workers to fill.

408
00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:26.31
Since 2010. America has
put more people back

409
00:24:26.31 --> 00:24:29.701
to work than Europe.
Japan. and all

410
00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:33.305
advanced economies
combined.

411
00:24:33.305 --> 00:24:37.175
(applause)

412
00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:39.411
Our manufacturers have
added almost 800.000

413
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:41.446
new jobs.

414
00:24:41.446 --> 00:24:43.447
Some of our bedrock
sectors. like our

415
00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:46.51
auto industry.
are booming.

416
00:24:46.51 --> 00:24:48.53
But there are also
millions of Americans

417
00:24:48.53 --> 00:24:50.55
who work in jobs that didn't
even exist 10 or 20 years

418
00:24:50.55 --> 00:24:52.390
ago -- jobs at companies
like Google. and eBay.

419
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:54.893
and Tesla.

420
00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:57.195
So no one knows for
certain which industries

421
00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:59.164
will generate the
jobs of the future.

422
00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:03.935
But we do know we want
them here in America.

423
00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:04.936
We know that.

424
00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:11.96
(applause)

425
00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:19.684
And that's why the
third part of

426
00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:21.753
middle-class economics is
all about building the

427
00:25:21.753 --> 00:25:25.122
most competitive economy
anywhere. the place where

428
00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:27.125
businesses want to
locate and hire.

429
00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:31.329
Twenty-first century
businesses need

430
00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:35.100
21st century infrastructure --
modern ports. and stronger

431
00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:40.671
bridges. faster trains.
and the fastest Internet.

432
00:25:40.672 --> 00:25:45.210
Democrats and Republicans
used to agree on this.

433
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.212
So let's set our
sights higher than

434
00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:48.213
a single oil
pipeline.

435
00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:51.683
Let's pass a bipartisan
infrastructure plan

436
00:25:51.683 --> 00:25:54.19
that could create more than
30 times as many jobs per

437
00:25:54.19 --> 00:25:55.854
year. and make this
country stronger

438
00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:57.455
for decades
to come.

439
00:25:57.455 --> 00:25:58.389
(applause)

440
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.724
Let's do it.

441
00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:02.4
Let's get
it done.

442
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.300
Let's get
it done.

443
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.134
(applause)

444
00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:11.336
Twenty-first century
businesses. including

445
00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:14.72
small businesses.
need to sell more

446
00:26:14.72 --> 00:26:17.375
American products
overseas.

447
00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:19.844
Today. our businesses
export more than ever.

448
00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:21.846
and exporters tend to
pay their workers

449
00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:23.815
higher wages.

450
00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:27.452
But as we speak. China
wants to write the rules

451
00:26:27.452 --> 00:26:29.988
for the world's
fastest-growing region.

452
00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:32.90
That would put our workers
and our businesses

453
00:26:32.90 --> 00:26:34.658
at a disadvantage.

454
00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:37.162
Why would we
let that happen?

455
00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:39.130
We should write
those rules.

456
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.333
We should level
the playing field.

457
00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:43.635
That's why I'm asking both
parties to give me trade

458
00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:46.204
promotion authority to
protect American workers.

459
00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:48.940
with strong new trade
deals from Asia to Europe

460
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.409
that aren't just free.
but are also fair.

461
00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:52.877
It's the right
thing to do.

462
00:26:52.877 --> 00:26:58.417
(applause)

463
00:27:06.257 --> 00:27:12.664
Look. I'm the first one
to admit that past trade

464
00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:14.799
deals haven't always lived
up to the hype. and that's

465
00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:17.668
why we've gone after
countries that break

466
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:20.438
the rules at
our expense.

467
00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:22.874
But 95 percent of the
world's customers

468
00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:25.643
live outside
our borders.

469
00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:27.12
We can't close
ourselves off

470
00:27:27.12 --> 00:27:29.813
from those
opportunities.

471
00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:32.250
More than half of
manufacturing executives

472
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.552
have said they're
actively looking

473
00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:37.121
to bring jobs
back from China.

474
00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:39.124
So let's give them
one more reason

475
00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:42.127
to get it done.

476
00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:44.195
Twenty-first century
businesses will rely

477
00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:48.233
on American science and
technology. research

478
00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:50.635
and development.

479
00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:52.771
I want the country
that eliminated polio

480
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:56.608
and mapped the human genome
to lead a new era of medicine

481
00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:58.610
-- one that delivers
the right treatment

482
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:59.610
at the right time.

483
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:06.131
(applause)

484
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.380
In some patients with
cystic fibrosis. this

485
00:28:08.386 --> 00:28:10.789
approach has reversed
a disease once

486
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:13.24
thought unstoppable.

487
00:28:13.24 --> 00:28:14.426
So tonight. I'm
launching a new

488
00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:17.195
Precision Medicine Initiative
to bring us closer

489
00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:20.465
to curing diseases like cancer
and diabetes. and to give

490
00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:23.101
all of us access to the
personalized information

491
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:26.671
we need to keep ourselves
and our families healthier.

492
00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:27.972
We can do this.

493
00:28:27.972 --> 00:28:33.311
(applause)

494
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.680
I intend to protect a free
and open Internet. extend

495
00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:47.459
its reach to every classroom.
and every community --

496
00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:48.726
(applause)

497
00:28:48.726 --> 00:28:51.429
-- and help folks build
the fastest networks

498
00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:52.697
so that the
next generation

499
00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:54.698
of digital innovators and
entrepreneurs have the

500
00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:58.603
platform to keep
reshaping our world.

501
00:28:58.603 --> 00:29:00.905
I want Americans to win
the race for the kinds

502
00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:04.242
of discoveries that unleash
new jobs -- converting

503
00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:07.611
sunlight into liquid fuel;
creating revolutionary

504
00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:10.115
prosthetics. so that a
veteran who gave his arms

505
00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:13.918
for his country can play
catch with his kids again.

506
00:29:13.918 --> 00:29:14.985
(applause)

507
00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:19.420
Pushing out into
the solar system

508
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.520
not just to visit.
but to stay.

509
00:29:22.527 --> 00:29:24.796
Now last month. we launched
a new spacecraft as part

510
00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:26.798
of a reenergized space
program that will

511
00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:28.800
send American
astronauts to Mars.

512
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.803
And in two months. to
prepare us for those

513
00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:36.74
missions. Scott Kelly will
begin a year-long stay

514
00:29:36.74 --> 00:29:37.909
in space.

515
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:39.611
So good luck.
Captain.

516
00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:43.14
Make sure to
Instagram it.

517
00:29:43.14 --> 00:29:44.549
We're proud
of you.

518
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:49.449
(applause)

519
00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:06.704
Now. the truth is. when
it comes to issues like

520
00:30:06.704 --> 00:30:10.608
infrastructure and basic
research. I know there's

521
00:30:10.608 --> 00:30:13.912
bipartisan support
in this chamber.

522
00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:15.914
Members of both parties
have told me so.

523
00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:20.485
Where we too often run
onto the rocks is how

524
00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:21.985
to pay for these
investments.

525
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:26.390
As Americans. we don't
mind paying our fair share

526
00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:29.994
of taxes as long as
everybody else does. too.

527
00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:33.363
But for far too long.
lobbyists have rigged

528
00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:36.134
the tax code with loopholes
that let some corporations

529
00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:40.305
pay nothing while others
pay full freight.

530
00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:42.307
They've riddled it with
giveaways that the

531
00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:44.776
super-rich don't need.
while denying a break

532
00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:48.379
to middle-class
families who do.

533
00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:52.617
This year. we have an
opportunity to change that.

534
00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:55.453
Let's close loopholes
so we stop rewarding

535
00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:57.555
companies that keep
profits abroad. and reward

536
00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:59.557
those that invest
here in America.

537
00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.419
(applause)

538
00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:13.571
Let's use those
savings to rebuild our

539
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.607
infrastructure and to
make it more attractive

540
00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:18.810
for companies to
bring jobs home.

541
00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.79
Let's simplify the system
and let a small business

542
00:31:21.79 --> 00:31:23.880
owner file based on her
actual bank statement.

543
00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:25.883
instead of the number
of accountants

544
00:31:25.883 --> 00:31:27.652
she can afford.

545
00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:31.122
(applause)

546
00:31:31.122 --> 00:31:33.124
And let's close
the loopholes that lead

547
00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:35.693
to inequality by allowing
the top one percent to avoid

548
00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:38.629
paying taxes on their
accumulated wealth.

549
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.632
We can use that money to
help more families pay

550
00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:43.935
for childcare and send
their kids to college.

551
00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:46.437
We need a tax code that
truly helps working

552
00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:49.139
Americans trying to get a
leg up in the new economy.

553
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.609
and we can achieve
that together.

554
00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:56.414
(applause)

555
00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:59.717
We can achieve
it together.

556
00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:07.458
Helping hardworking
families make ends meet.

557
00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:09.527
Giving them the tools
they need for good-paying

558
00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:12.163
jobs in this
new economy.

559
00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:14.465
Maintaining the
conditions of growth

560
00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:17.34
and competitiveness.

561
00:32:17.35 --> 00:32:20.405
This is where
America needs to go.

562
00:32:20.405 --> 00:32:23.107
I believe it's where the
American people want to go.

563
00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:28.446
It will make our economy
stronger a year from now.

564
00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:31.983
15 years from now. and deep
into the century ahead.

565
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.322
Of course. if there's one
thing this new century has

566
00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:39.756
taught us. it's that we
cannot separate our work

567
00:32:39.757 --> 00:32:42.126
here at home from challenges
beyond our shores.

568
00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:46.563
My first duty as
Commander-in-Chief

569
00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:48.566
is to defend the United
States of America.

570
00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:55.39
In doing so. the question
is not whether America

571
00:32:55.39 --> 00:32:58.279
leads in the
world. but how.

572
00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.940
When we make rash
decisions. reacting

573
00:32:59.944 --> 00:33:03.447
to the headlines instead of
using our heads; when the

574
00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:07.285
first response to a challenge
is to send in our military --

575
00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:09.654
then we risk getting
drawn into unnecessary

576
00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:13.157
conflicts. and neglect the
broader strategy we need

577
00:33:13.157 --> 00:33:16.461
for a safer. more
prosperous world.

578
00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:20.64
That's what our
enemies want us to do.

579
00:33:20.64 --> 00:33:22.467
I believe in a smarter kind
of American leadership.

580
00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:27.238
We lead best when we
combine military power

581
00:33:27.238 --> 00:33:30.708
with strong diplomacy;
when we leverage our power

582
00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:34.412
with coalition building;
when we don't let our

583
00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:36.914
fears blind us to the
opportunities that

584
00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:38.916
this new century
presents.

585
00:33:40.318 --> 00:33:42.320
That's exactly what
we're doing right now.

586
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.355
And around the globe. it
is making a difference.

587
00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:50.561
First. we stand united
with people around the

588
00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:52.663
world who have been
targeted by terrorists --

589
00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:56.200
from a school in Pakistan
to the streets of Paris.

590
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.301
(applause)

591
00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:58.636
We will continue
to hunt down

592
00:33:58.636 --> 00:34:01.439
terrorists and dismantle
their networks. and

593
00:34:01.439 --> 00:34:04.776
we reserve the right to act
unilaterally. as we have

594
00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:07.378
done relentlessly since I
took office to take out

595
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:09.13
terrorists who pose
a direct threat

596
00:34:09.13 --> 00:34:10.815
to us and
our allies.

597
00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:16.754
(applause)

598
00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:20.992
At the same time. we've
learned some costly

599
00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:24.328
lessons over the
last 13 years.

600
00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:26.163
Instead of Americans
patrolling the valleys of

601
00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:30.435
Afghanistan. we've trained
their security forces. who

602
00:34:30.435 --> 00:34:33.36
have now taken the lead.
and we've honored our

603
00:34:33.36 --> 00:34:35.305
troops' sacrifice by
supporting that country's

604
00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:38.909
first democratic
transition.

605
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:42.245
Instead of sending large
ground forces overseas.

606
00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:44.282
we're partnering with
nations from South Asia

607
00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:47.952
to North Africa to deny
safe haven to terrorists

608
00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:50.822
who threaten America.

609
00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:55.460
In Iraq and Syria.
American leadership --

610
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.196
including our military
power -- is stopping

611
00:34:58.196 --> 00:35:00.631
ISIL's advance.

612
00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:02.633
Instead of getting dragged
into another ground war

613
00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:05.403
in the Middle East. we are
leading a broad coalition.

614
00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:08.38
including Arab nations.
to degrade and ultimately

615
00:35:08.39 --> 00:35:11.309
destroy this
terrorist group.

616
00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:14.512
(applause)

617
00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:15.880
We're also supporting
a moderate

618
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.782
opposition in Syria that
can help us in this

619
00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:20.885
effort. and assisting
people everywhere who

620
00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.887
stand up to the
bankrupt ideology

621
00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:25.756
of violent
extremism.

622
00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:28.893
Now. this effort
will take time.

623
00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:31.629
It will
require focus.

624
00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:34.265
But we will
succeed.

625
00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:36.267
And tonight. I call on
this Congress to show

626
00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:38.535
the world that we are
united in this mission

627
00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:40.972
by passing a resolution
to authorize the use

628
00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:43.107
of force
against ISIL.

629
00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:45.643
We need that
authority.

630
00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:48.3
(applause)

631
00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:52.415
Second. we're
demonstrating the power

632
00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:56.320
of American strength
and diplomacy.

633
00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.322
We're upholding the
principle that bigger

634
00:35:58.322 --> 00:36:01.926
nations can't bully the
small -- by opposing

635
00:36:01.926 --> 00:36:04.61
Russian aggression. and
supporting Ukraine's

636
00:36:04.61 --> 00:36:06.831
democracy. and reassuring
our NATO allies.

637
00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.833
(applause)

638
00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:23.781
Last year. as we were
doing the hard work

639
00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:26.116
of imposing sanctions
along with our allies.

640
00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:31.956
as we were reinforcing our
presence with frontline

641
00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:35.993
states. Mr. Putin's
aggression it was

642
00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:38.596
suggested was a masterful
display of strategy

643
00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:39.597
and strength.

644
00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:42.500
That's what I heard
from some folks.

645
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.2
Well. today. it is America
that stands strong and

646
00:36:45.2 --> 00:36:48.739
united with our allies.
while Russia is isolated

647
00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:52.109
with its economy
in tatters.

648
00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:55.346
That's how America leads
-- not with bluster.

649
00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:58.382
but with persistent.
steady resolve.

650
00:36:58.382 --> 00:37:05.389
(applause)

651
00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:09.93
In Cuba. we are ending
a policy that was long

652
00:37:09.93 --> 00:37:10.428
past its
expiration date.

653
00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:20.4
(applause)

654
00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:25.509
When what you're
doing doesn't work

655
00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:28.579
for 50 years. it's time
to try something new.

656
00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:33.17
(applause)

657
00:37:33.17 --> 00:37:34.417
And our shift in
Cuba policy has the

658
00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:36.887
potential to end a
legacy of mistrust

659
00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:38.656
in our hemisphere.

660
00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:42.356
It removes a phony excuse
for restrictions in Cuba.

661
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.695
It stands up for
democratic values.

662
00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:46.63
and extends the
hand of friendship

663
00:37:46.63 --> 00:37:47.723
to the Cuban
people.

664
00:37:47.723 --> 00:37:49.303
And this year. Congress
should begin the

665
00:37:49.303 --> 00:37:51.542
work of ending
the embargo.

666
00:37:51.543 --> 00:37:58.376
(applause)

667
00:37:58.376 --> 00:38:03.581
As His Holiness. Pope
Francis. has said.

668
00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:07.385
diplomacy is the work
of "small steps."

669
00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:09.920
These small steps have
added up to new hope

670
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.490
for the future
in Cuba.

671
00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:15.91
And after years in prison.
we are overjoyed that

672
00:38:15.92 --> 00:38:17.228
Alan Gross is back
where he belongs.

673
00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:19.63
Welcome
home. Alan.

674
00:38:19.63 --> 00:38:20.798
We're glad
you're here.

675
00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:36.846
(applause)

676
00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:42.787
Our diplomacy is at work
with respect to Iran.

677
00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:46.223
where. for the first time
in a decade. we've halted

678
00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:48.225
the progress of its
nuclear program and

679
00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:50.327
reduced its stockpile
of nuclear material.

680
00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.399
Between now and this
spring. we have a chance

681
00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:57.734
to negotiate a
comprehensive agreement

682
00:38:57.735 --> 00:39:00.805
that prevents a
nuclear-armed Iran.

683
00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:02.839
secures America and our
allies -- including

684
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.9
Israel. while
avoiding yet another

685
00:39:05.9 --> 00:39:08.340
Middle East
conflict.

686
00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.80
There are no guarantees
that negotiations will

687
00:39:10.81 --> 00:39:13.651
succeed. and I keep all
options on the table

688
00:39:13.651 --> 00:39:16.921
to prevent a
nuclear Iran.

689
00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:20.558
But new sanctions passed
by this Congress. at this

690
00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:23.561
moment in time. will
all but guarantee

691
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:27.698
that diplomacy fails
-- alienating America

692
00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:31.35
from its allies; making
it harder to maintain

693
00:39:31.35 --> 00:39:34.138
sanctions; and ensuring
that Iran starts

694
00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.107
up its nuclear
program again.

695
00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.875
It doesn't
make sense.

696
00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:40.344
And that's why I will veto
any new sanctions bill

697
00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:42.346
that threatens to
undo this progress.

698
00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:47.86
(applause)

699
00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:53.124
The American people
expect us only

700
00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:56.827
to go to war as a last
resort. and I intend

701
00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:58.95
to stay true to
that wisdom.

702
00:39:58.95 --> 00:40:03.667
Third. we're looking
beyond the issues that

703
00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:05.669
have consumed us in
the past to shape

704
00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:08.4
the coming
century.

705
00:40:08.5 --> 00:40:10.508
No foreign nation. no
hacker. should be able

706
00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:13.210
to shut down our networks.
steal our trade secrets.

707
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.713
or invade the privacy
of American families.

708
00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:17.81
especially our kids.

709
00:40:17.81 --> 00:40:21.641
(applause)

710
00:40:31.20 --> 00:40:32.860
So we're making
sure our government

711
00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:35.165
integrates intelligence
to combat cyber threats.

712
00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:37.168
just as we have done
to combat terrorism.

713
00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:40.337
And tonight. I urge this
Congress to finally pass

714
00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:43.73
the legislation we need to
better meet the evolving

715
00:40:43.73 --> 00:40:46.442
threat of cyber attacks.
combat identity theft.

716
00:40:46.443 --> 00:40:48.913
and protect our
children's information.

717
00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:51.916
That should be a
bipartisan effort.

718
00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:57.556
(applause)

719
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.860
If we don't act. we'll
leave our nation and

720
00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:07.64
our economy
vulnerable.

721
00:41:07.64 --> 00:41:09.200
If we do. we can
continue to protect

722
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.702
the technologies that
have unleashed untold

723
00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:15.660
opportunities for people
around the globe.

724
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.975
In West Africa. our
troops. our scientists.

725
00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:21.946
our doctors. our nurses.
our health care workers

726
00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:24.714
are rolling back Ebola --
saving countless lives

727
00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:26.717
and stopping the
spread of disease.

728
00:41:26.717 --> 00:41:32.690
(applause)

729
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.892
I could not be
prouder of them.

730
00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:37.895
and I thank this Congress
for your bipartisan support

731
00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:40.95
of their efforts.

732
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.860
But the job is not yet
done. and the world

733
00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:44.568
needs to use this lesson
to build a more effective

734
00:41:44.568 --> 00:41:47.37
global effort to prevent
the spread of future

735
00:41:47.37 --> 00:41:49.473
pandemics. invest in
smart development.

736
00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:52.42
and eradicate
extreme poverty.

737
00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:56.814
In the Asia Pacific. we
are modernizing alliances

738
00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:58.816
while making sure that
other nations play

739
00:41:58.816 --> 00:42:02.285
by the rules -- in how they
trade. how they resolve

740
00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:05.556
maritime disputes.
how they participate

741
00:42:05.556 --> 00:42:07.558
in meeting common
international challenges

742
00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:11.896
like nonproliferation
and disaster relief.

743
00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:15.299
And no challenge
-- no challenge --

744
00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:18.2
poses a greater threat
to future generations

745
00:42:18.2 --> 00:42:20.237
than climate change.

746
00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:25.477
(applause)

747
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:40.591
2014 was the planet's
warmest year on record.

748
00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:44.627
Now. one year doesn't make
a trend. but this does:

749
00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:48.699
14 of the 15 warmest years
on record have all fallen

750
00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:50.701
in the first 15 years
of this century.

751
00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:55.439
I've heard some folks try
to dodge the evidence

752
00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:58.575
by saying they're not
scientists; that we don't

753
00:42:58.575 --> 00:43:01.245
have enough
information to act.

754
00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:04.80
Well. I'm not a
scientist. either.

755
00:43:04.81 --> 00:43:06.550
But you know what. I know
a lot of really good

756
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:09.987
scientists at NASA. and
at NOAA. and at our

757
00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:11.221
major universities.

758
00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:13.657
And the best scientists in
the world are all telling

759
00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:16.937
us that our activities
are changing the climate.

760
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:20.60
and if we don't act
forcefully. we'll continue

761
00:43:20.64 --> 00:43:25.269
to see rising oceans.
longer. hotter heat waves.

762
00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:28.205
dangerous droughts and
floods. and massive

763
00:43:28.205 --> 00:43:30.708
disruptions that can
trigger greater migration

764
00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:33.177
and conflict and hunger
around the globe.

765
00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:37.314
The Pentagon says that
climate change poses

766
00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:40.116
immediate risks to our
national security.

767
00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:43.354
We should act
like it.

768
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:50.227
(applause)

769
00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:53.140
And that's why. over the
past six years. we've done

770
00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.460
more than ever to
combat climate change.

771
00:43:56.467 --> 00:44:00.337
from the way we produce
energy to the way we use it.

772
00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:02.339
That's why we've set
aside more public lands

773
00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:05.439
and waters than any
administration in history.

774
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.578
And that's why I will not
let this Congress endanger

775
00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.580
the health of our
children by turning

776
00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.15
back the clock
on our efforts.

777
00:44:11.15 --> 00:44:13.350
I am determined
to make sure that

778
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.787
American leadership drives
international action.

779
00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:22.406
(applause)

780
00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:30.300
In Beijing. we made a
historic announcement:

781
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.302
The United States will
double the pace at which

782
00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:33.470
we cut carbon
pollution.

783
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.939
And China committed.
for the first time.

784
00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:38.107
to limiting
their emissions.

785
00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:40.110
And because the world's
two largest economies

786
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:43.981
came together. other nations
are now stepping up.

787
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:46.984
and offering hope that
this year the world will

788
00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:48.986
finally reach an
agreement to protect

789
00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:50.953
the one planet
we've got.

790
00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:56.894
And there's one last
pillar of our leadership.

791
00:44:56.894 --> 00:45:00.863
and that's the example
of our values.

792
00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:04.234
As Americans. we respect
human dignity. even when

793
00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:07.337
we're threatened. which
is why I have prohibited

794
00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:10.240
torture. and worked to
make sure our use of new

795
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.511
technology like drones
is properly constrained.

796
00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:19.650
(applause)

797
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.18
It's why we speak
out against the

798
00:45:21.18 --> 00:45:23.353
deplorable anti-Semitism
that has resurfaced

799
00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:26.123
in certain parts
of the world.

800
00:45:26.123 --> 00:45:27.558
(applause)

801
00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:28.492
It's why we
continue to reject

802
00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:31.295
offensive stereotypes of
Muslims. the vast majority

803
00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:35.632
of whom share our
commitment to peace.

804
00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:38.669
That's why we defend free
speech. and advocate

805
00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:41.839
for political prisoners.
and condemn the persecution

806
00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:44.441
of women. or religious
minorities. or people

807
00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:47.310
who are lesbian. gay.
bisexual or transgender.

808
00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.413
We do these things not
only because they are

809
00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.849
the right thing to do. but
because ultimately they

810
00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:53.650
will make us safer.

811
00:45:53.650 --> 00:46:00.230
(applause)

812
00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:09.566
As Americans. we
have a profound

813
00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:11.868
commitment to
justice.

814
00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:15.305
So it makes no sense
to spend $3 million

815
00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:18.442
per prisoner to keep open
a prison that the world

816
00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:21.745
condemns and terrorists
use to recruit.

817
00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:23.212
(applause)

818
00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:25.315
Since I've been
President. we've worked

819
00:46:25.315 --> 00:46:27.284
responsibly to cut
the population

820
00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.986
of Gitmo in half.

821
00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:31.188
Now it is time to
finish the job.

822
00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:33.423
And I will not relent
in my determination

823
00:46:33.423 --> 00:46:34.424
to shut it down.

824
00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:37.480
It is not
who we are.

825
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.640
It's time to
close Gitmo.

826
00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.839
(applause)

827
00:46:49.72 --> 00:46:52.442
As Americans. we cherish
our civil liberties.

828
00:46:52.442 --> 00:46:54.778
and we need to uphold
that commitment

829
00:46:54.778 --> 00:46:56.812
if we want maximum
cooperation from other

830
00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:59.383
countries and industry
in our fight against

831
00:46:59.383 --> 00:47:01.484
terrorist networks.

832
00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:03.820
So while some have moved
on from the debates over

833
00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.925
our surveillance
programs. I have not.

834
00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:09.927
As promised. our
intelligence agencies

835
00:47:09.927 --> 00:47:12.496
have worked hard. with the
recommendations of privacy

836
00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:14.932
advocates. to increase
transparency and build

837
00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:18.51
more safeguards against
potential abuse.

838
00:47:18.60 --> 00:47:19.799
And next month. we'll
issue a report on how

839
00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:21.872
we're keeping our promise
to keep our country safe

840
00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:23.874
while strengthening
privacy.

841
00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:29.846
Looking to the future
instead of the past.

842
00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:32.482
Making sure we match our
power with diplomacy.

843
00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:35.452
and use force
wisely.

844
00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:37.454
Building coalitions to
meet new challenges

845
00:47:37.454 --> 00:47:38.455
and opportunities.

846
00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:42.926
Leading -- always -- with
the example of our values.

847
00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:48.932
That's what makes
us exceptional.

848
00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:50.933
That's what
keeps us strong.

849
00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:54.904
That's why we have to keep
striving to hold ourselves

850
00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:58.375
to the highest of
standards -- our own.

851
00:48:02.246 --> 00:48:06.450
You know. just over
a decade ago. I gave

852
00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.452
a speech in Boston where
I said there wasn't

853
00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:11.788
a liberal America or a
conservative America;

854
00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:15.292
a black America or a
white America -- but

855
00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:17.60
a United States
of America.

856
00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:22.232
I said this because I had
seen it in my own life.

857
00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:28.572
in a nation that gave someone
like me a chance; because

858
00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:31.174
I grew up in Hawaii. a
melting pot of races and

859
00:48:31.174 --> 00:48:35.679
customs; because I made
Illinois my home --

860
00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:40.317
a state of small towns.
rich farmland. one of the

861
00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:44.521
world's great cities; a
microcosm of the country

862
00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:46.56
where Democrats
and Republicans

863
00:48:46.56 --> 00:48:50.60
and Independents. good
people of every ethnicity

864
00:48:50.60 --> 00:48:53.630
and every faith. share
certain bedrock values.

865
00:48:56.733 --> 00:48:59.69
Over the past six years.
the pundits have pointed

866
00:48:59.69 --> 00:49:02.639
out more than once that
my presidency hasn't

867
00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:04.641
delivered on
this vision.

868
00:49:06.76 --> 00:49:08.779
How ironic. they say.
that our politics seems

869
00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.781
more divided than ever.

870
00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:16.453
It's held up as proof not
just of my own flaws --

871
00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:20.123
of which there are many
-- but also as proof that

872
00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:25.595
the vision itself is
misguided. naïve.

873
00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:27.631
that there are too many
people in this town who

874
00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:30.866
actually benefit from
partisanship and gridlock

875
00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:36.740
for us to ever do
anything about it.

876
00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.42
I know how tempting
such cynicism may be.

877
00:49:42.79 --> 00:49:44.81
But I still think the
cynics are wrong.

878
00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:49.685
I still believe that
we are one people.

879
00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:52.622
I still believe that
together. we can do great

880
00:49:52.622 --> 00:49:55.292
things. even when
the odds are long.

881
00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:58.127
(applause)

882
00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:01.331
I believe this
because over and over

883
00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:07.170
in my six years in office. I
have seen America at its best.

884
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.573
I've seen the hopeful
faces of young graduates

885
00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:11.808
from New York to
California. and our newest

886
00:50:11.808 --> 00:50:14.845
officers at West
Point. Annapolis.

887
00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:17.214
Colorado Springs.
New London.

888
00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:23.185
I've mourned with grieving
families in Tucson and

889
00:50:23.186 --> 00:50:28.725
Newtown. in Boston.
in West Texas.

890
00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:31.627
and West Virginia.

891
00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:33.864
I've watched Americans
beat back adversity from

892
00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:37.134
the Gulf Coast to the
Great Plains. from Midwest

893
00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:41.671
assembly lines to the
Mid-Atlantic seaboard.

894
00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:43.740
I've seen something like
gay marriage go from

895
00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.877
a wedge issue used to
drive us apart to a story

896
00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:49.446
of freedom across our
country. a civil right now

897
00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:54.284
legal in states that seven
in 10 Americans call home.

898
00:50:54.284 --> 00:51:00.124
(applause)

899
00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.234
So I know the good.
and optimistic. and

900
00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:13.603
big-hearted generosity of
the American people who

901
00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:17.307
every day live the
idea that we are our

902
00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:19.308
brother's keeper and
our sister's keeper.

903
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:23.747
And I know they expect
those of us who serve

904
00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:27.850
here to set a
better example.

905
00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:31.455
So the question for those
of us here tonight is how

906
00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:35.525
we. all of us. can better
reflect America's hopes.

907
00:51:38.695 --> 00:51:41.865
I've served in Congress
with many of you.

908
00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:42.866
I know many
of you well.

909
00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:46.536
There are a lot of good
people here. on both

910
00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:49.736
sides of the aisle.

911
00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.939
And many of you have
told me that this isn't

912
00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:55.712
what you signed up for --
arguing past each other

913
00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:59.916
on cable shows. the
constant fundraising.

914
00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:02.85
always looking over your
shoulder at how the base

915
00:52:02.85 --> 00:52:04.87
will react to
every decision.

916
00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:08.925
Imagine if we broke out of
these tired old patterns.

917
00:52:11.27 --> 00:52:13.29
Imagine if we did
something different.

918
00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:18.201
Understand. a better
politics isn't one where

919
00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:20.837
Democrats abandon their
agenda or Republicans

920
00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.839
simply embrace mine.

921
00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:26.243
A better politics is one
where we appeal to each

922
00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:27.844
other's basic
decency instead

923
00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:29.846
of our basest
fears.

924
00:52:31.214 --> 00:52:33.316
A better politics is one
where we debate without

925
00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:36.986
demonizing each other;
where we talk issues and

926
00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:40.557
values. and principles
and facts. rather than

927
00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:44.426
"gotcha" moments. or
trivial gaffes. or fake

928
00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:46.663
controversies that have
nothing to do with

929
00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:49.399
people's
daily lives.

930
00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:52.636
(applause)

931
00:52:52.636 --> 00:53:01.378
A politics -- a better
politics is one where

932
00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:03.747
we spend less time drowning
in dark money for ads that

933
00:53:03.747 --> 00:53:06.116
pull us into the gutter.
and spend more time

934
00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:09.185
lifting young people up
with a sense of purpose

935
00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:13.757
and possibility. asking
them to join in the

936
00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:18.617
great mission of
building America.

937
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.720
If we're going to have
arguments. let's have

938
00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:24.401
arguments. but let's
make them debates worthy

939
00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:26.603
of this body and worthy
of this country.

940
00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:32.75
We still may not agree on
a woman's right to choose.

941
00:53:32.75 --> 00:53:34.477
but surely we can agree
it's a good thing that

942
00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:36.546
teen pregnancies and
abortions are nearing

943
00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:38.848
all-time lows. and that
every woman should have

944
00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:40.850
access to the health
care that she needs.

945
00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:48.750
(applause)

946
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.900
Yes. passions still fly on
immigration. but surely

947
00:53:57.901 --> 00:53:59.903
we can all see something of
ourselves in the striving

948
00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:04.707
young student. and agree
that no one benefits when

949
00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:08.311
a hardworking mom is
snatched from her child.

950
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:10.714
and that it's possible to
shape a law that upholds

951
00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:13.316
our tradition as a nation
of laws and a nation

952
00:54:13.316 --> 00:54:15.317
of immigrants.

953
00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:20.523
I've talked to Republicans
and Democrats about that.

954
00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:24.194
That's something
that we can share.

955
00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:27.130
We may go at it in
campaign season.

956
00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.733
but surely we can agree
that the right to vote

957
00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:32.602
is sacred; that it's being
denied to too many --

958
00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:33.803
(applause)

959
00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:35.805
-- and that on this
50th anniversary

960
00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:38.841
of the great march from
Selma to Montgomery and

961
00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:41.211
the passage of the Voting
Rights Act. we can come

962
00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:44.13
together. Democrats and
Republicans. to make

963
00:54:44.14 --> 00:54:46.149
voting easier for
every single American.

964
00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:52.355
(applause)

965
00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:54.90
We may have different
takes on the events

966
00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:59.799
of Ferguson
and New York.

967
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.297
But surely we can
understand a father

968
00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:03.500
who fears his son can't
walk home without

969
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.101
being harassed.

970
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:07.103
And surely we can
understand the wife

971
00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:09.105
who won't rest until
the police officer

972
00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:11.107
she married walks through
the front door at the

973
00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:12.75
end of his shift.

974
00:55:12.75 --> 00:55:13.109
(applause)

975
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:15.111
And surely we can
agree that it's

976
00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:17.113
a good thing that for the
first time in 40 years.

977
00:55:17.113 --> 00:55:19.249
the crime rate and the
incarceration rate

978
00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:22.151
have come down together.
and use that as a starting

979
00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:25.155
point for Democrats and
Republicans. community

980
00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.424
leaders and law
enforcement. to reform

981
00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:29.426
America's criminal
justice system so that

982
00:55:29.426 --> 00:55:33.296
it protects and
serves all of us.

983
00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:44.174
(applause)

984
00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:52.248
That's a better
politics.

985
00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:55.351
That's how we start
rebuilding trust.

986
00:55:55.351 --> 00:55:58.888
That's how we move
this country forward.

987
00:55:58.888 --> 00:56:00.890
That's what the
American people want.

988
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:02.926
And that's what
they deserve.

989
00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:10.166
I have no more
campaigns to run.

990
00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:11.234
(applause)

991
00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:12.202
My only agenda --

992
00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:15.105
(laughter)

993
00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:17.707
-- I know because I
won both of them.

994
00:56:17.707 --> 00:56:23.680
(applause)

995
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.480
Yeah.

996
00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:30.520
(applause)

997
00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:40.964
My only agenda for
the next two years

998
00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:42.899
is the same as the one I've
had since the day I swore

999
00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:46.402
an oath on the steps of
this Capitol -- to do what

1000
00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:48.404
I believe is
best for America.

1001
00:56:51.74 --> 00:56:53.276
If you share the broad
vision I outlined tonight.

1002
00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:56.346
I ask you to join me
in the work at hand.

1003
00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:03.119
If you disagree with parts
of it. I hope you'll

1004
00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:06.299
at least work with me
where you do agree.

1005
00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.120
And I commit to every
Republican here tonight

1006
00:57:08.124 --> 00:57:10.125
that I will not only
seek out your ideas.

1007
00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:12.195
I will seek to work
with you to make

1008
00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:13.797
this country
stronger.

1009
00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:19.502
(applause)

1010
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.711
Because I want this
chamber. I want this city

1011
00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:33.116
to reflect the truth --
that for all our blind

1012
00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:36.953
spots and shortcomings.
we are a people with the

1013
00:57:36.953 --> 00:57:41.224
strength and generosity of
spirit to bridge divides.

1014
00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:45.94
to unite in common effort.
to help our neighbors.

1015
00:57:45.94 --> 00:57:47.96
whether down the street
or on the other

1016
00:57:47.96 --> 00:57:49.699
side of the world.

1017
00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:52.435
I want our actions to
tell every child in every

1018
00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:55.337
neighborhood. your life
matters. and we are

1019
00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:58.7
committed to improving
your life chances as

1020
00:57:58.7 --> 00:58:00.9
committed as we are
to working on behalf

1021
00:58:00.9 --> 00:58:01.477
of our own kids.

1022
00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:03.245
(applause)

1023
00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:05.415
I want future
generations to know

1024
00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:08.317
that we are a people who see
our differences as a great

1025
00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:12.255
gift. that we're a people
who value the dignity and

1026
00:58:12.255 --> 00:58:16.92
worth of every citizen --
man and woman. young and

1027
00:58:16.92 --> 00:58:18.828
old. black and white.
Latino. Asian. immigrant.

1028
00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:22.332
Native American. gay.
straight. Americans

1029
00:58:22.332 --> 00:58:25.535
with mental illness or
physical disability.

1030
00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:26.536
Everybody matters.

1031
00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:29.739
I want them to grow up
in a country that shows

1032
00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:33.943
the world what we
still know to be true:

1033
00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:36.312
that we are still more than
a collection of red states

1034
00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:38.714
and blue states;
that we are the

1035
00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:41.84
United States
of America.

1036
00:58:41.84 --> 00:58:46.359
(applause)

1037
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.335
I want them to grow up in
a country where a young

1038
00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:03.940
mom can sit down and write
a letter to her President

1039
00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:07.377
with a story that sums
up these past six years:

1040
00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:12.448
"It's amazing what you can
bounce back from when you

1041
00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:17.453
have to...we are a strong.
tight-knit family who's

1042
00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:19.555
made it through some
very. very hard times."

1043
00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:26.129
My fellow Americans.
we. too. are a strong.

1044
00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:28.631
tight-knit
family.

1045
00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:30.833
We. too. have made it
through some hard times.

1046
00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:35.71
Fifteen years into this
new century. we have

1047
00:59:35.71 --> 00:59:38.141
picked ourselves up.
dusted ourselves off.

1048
00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:42.400
and begun again the work
of remaking America.

1049
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.814
We have laid a
new foundation.

1050
00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:47.951
A brighter future
is ours to write.

1051
00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:50.920
Let's begin this new
